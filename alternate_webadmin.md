## Alternate OpenVPN WebAdmin installation

An improved version of this original, which not only changed the design but also the structure of the code, up to modular extensions, can be found here:

This alternative is, unlike the original, state of the art, uses yarn instead of bower, is much more flexible and secure than the original and has such problems as password assignment fixed from issue #145, allows password changes etc. Personalised login pages are possible, status overviews, help pages, own texts for user instructions, multilingualism and much more.

The live test is currently the personalised allocation of IP addresses. In preparation is the administration of TLS keys (User based Certs). Further features are in planning or already in progress.
